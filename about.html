    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>I’ve been an Administrative Assistant, Executive Assistant and 
    Project Coordinator for the past 20 years. I love what I do, and I 
    am excellent at it. However, I have been laid off so many times, 
    I have decided to take a different career path.
    </p>

    <p>I believe in divine intervention. My last job laid me off without 
      notice due to budget issues. I was surprised, but not devastated. At my age, 
      I thought I would retire from this job, so I had to ask myself, why this was happening. 
    </p>

    <p>Then I had an epiphany. I realized that I was at a crossroads in life. 
    It was time for me to take my skills, knowledge and background and put all my attributes 
    together and start my own business and control my own fate. I immediately sat down 
    and started to write out a business plan.</p>
    <h3>My Plan</h3>
    <p>My business plan is simple – become a virtual assistant and 
      offer my skills to small and start-up businesses. The average 
      small company cannot afford to hire someone of my experience 
      nd background. A company would have to pay me a minimum rate of 
      $20 - $25 hourly plus benefits. With me working 40 to 40 plus 
      hours weekly, that would reach far beyond their budget.
    </p>
    <p>But, if I contract to small and start-up companies, they would 
      gladly pay me! This is how it would work. Most small businesses and 
      start-ups are focused on growing their business and they either 
      don’t have time for the administrative tasks or don’t know how to 
      organize administrative tasks.
    </p>
    <h3>Scenerios</h3>
    
    <p>Let’s say Company A needs someone to complete Basic 
      administrative tasks.  However, they only need someone to do 
      this for about 20 hours monthly. I can develop a monthly package 
      of Basic Support Services of $500.</p>

  <p>For instance, let’s look at Company B. They’re a new start-up company, 
  maybe eight employees. They need someone to develop policies and procedures. 
  This project could easily take 40 to 100 hours over the course of 30 days. 
  At a rate of $30 per hour, this could become quite profitable.</p>
  <p>The core to being successful is to have multiple clients at any given time, working many 
    clients and many projects, and to always do excellent work and deliver timely. 
    As my business grows, I will continue to take more classes, learning more and offering 
    more services to my clients to grow my business and myself. If you are interested in my 
    background, knowledge and skill set, please review <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=4e83dd4b0d&attid=0.1&permmsgid=msg-f:1671202178691120456&th=17314d86f0be3d48&view=att&disp=inline">my resume</a>.</p>
